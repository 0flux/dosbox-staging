# 0.81.1 release notes

**Release date:** 2024-03-14

## Summary

This maintenance release addresses the following issues:

- Fix **Wing Commander 3** regression where the videos and cutscenes appeared
  height-doubled.

- Fix regression where the Tandy version of **Impossible Mission II** crashed
  when starting the game.

- Fix regression where the DOSBox Staging window was brought to the foreground
  on emulated video mode changes.

- Fix various VGA double scanning related edge cases (mostly for demoscene
  productions). Forcing single scanning via `crt-auto-arcade` should now work
  with a wider range of programs.

- Improve handling of multiple joysticks/game controllers (if you had more
  than a single controller connected, the mapper could behave erratically).

Apart from these fixes, new Spanish and Brazilian translations have also been
added.


## How to upgrade

Start by downloading the latest version, then make sure to upgrade your
primary configuration as described below.

### Downloads

- [Windows](../windows.md)
- [macOS](../macos.md)
- [Linux](../linux.md)

### Upgrading your primary configuration

Since config settings might be renamed, altered, or deprecated between
releases, it's best to let DOSBox Staging write the new default primary config
on the first launch, then reapply your old settings manually.

Start by backing up your existing primary config. This is where to find
it on each platform:

<div class="compact" markdown>

| <!-- --> | <!-- -->
|----------|----------
| **Windows**  | `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\DOSBox\dosbox-staging.conf`
| **macOS**    | `~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/dosbox-staging.conf`
| **Linux**    | `~/.config/dosbox/dosbox-staging.conf`

</div>

You can also execute DOSBox Staging with the `--printconf` option to have the
location of the primary config printed to your console.

After backing up the existing primary config, simply start the new version---a
new `dosbox-staging.conf` will be written containing the new defaults and
updated setting descriptions.

!!! note "Portable mode notes"

    In portable mode, `dosbox-staging.conf` resides in the same folder as your
    DOSBox Staging executable. The migration steps for portable mode users are
    as follows:

      - Unpack the new version into a _new_ folder (this is important).
      - Create a new _empty_ `dosbox-staging.conf` file in the new folder to
        enable portable mode.
      - Launch the new version.

    DOSBox Staging will write the new defaults to the empty
    `dosbox-staging.conf` file. After this, you carry over your settings from
    the old primary config manually.

### After upgrading

Look out for deprecation warnings in the logs (in yellow/orange colour) and
update your configs accordingly.
