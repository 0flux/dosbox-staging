   Version 2.50

   1. CRC of packed data is now stored for file parts split between
      volumes. It allows localization of a damaged volume, if volumes
      set contains one large compressed file.

   2. New command line switches:

      a) -sv - create independent solid volumes.

         When this option is on, RAR tries to create solid volumes
         which are independent one each another, so if one
         volume is lost, files in following volumes may  still be
         accessible.Note than sometimes this option cannot help, for
         example, if volumes contain one large file. This option
         slightly decreases solid volumes compression ratio, but
         seriously increases reliability due to data loss because of
         poor media quality.

      b) -ac (clear "Archive" attribute) now can be used not only
         when archiving, but also when extracting files to clear
         "Archive" attribute on extracted files;

      c) -ap<path> - set path inside archive. It allows to add files
         to a specified archive folder when archiving or to remove
         the specified part of path from file names when extracting.
