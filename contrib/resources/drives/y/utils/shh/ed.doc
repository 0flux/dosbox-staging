                                      INTRODUCTION
                                      ============



          "SHH ED" (hereafter called ED) is a simple text editor inspired by 
          the editors in older versions of Borland's compilers. These are 
          based on good old WordStar.

          The problem with the newer Borland editors is that they are `stuck' 
          in an enormous integrated environment. If you wish to use Borland's 
          integrated editors for other things than writing programs, there's 
          no choice to leave everything except the editor out. This results 
          in several seconds for loading.

          This is especially annoying when programming using the command line 
          compiler. Start the editor, edit the text, quit the editor, compile 
          the program, restart the editor etc. This just takes too long.

          With that as a background, i tried to make a _small_ text editor 
          not too different from (old versions of) Borland's intergrated 
          editors.




                                          RULES
                                          =====



          ED is `FreeWare'. This means that you can copy and use the program 
          as much as you wish, as long as you stick to the following `rules':

             * You are not allowed to sell the program. You might sell 
               diskettes containing the program and charge a small fee for 
               it.

             * When copying the program, all files must be included. No file 
               must be changed in any way.

             * I shall not be held liable for any loss or damage due to using 
               this program. There is no warranty at all.

          I would be happy if you report any bugs you find. I consider ED a 
          finished project (not that I mean the program is finished, but I 
          have no intention extending it), so I will not make any changes or 
          extensions to how ED works. I will of course try to fix bugs, 
          though.

          In addition, I would like you to tell me if you use this program. 
          That's not too much to ask, is it? :-)

                                       STARTING ED
                                       ===========



          ED is started using the command ED. Add a filename if you wish to 
          go directly into a file.

              ED filename

          If no filename is given, ED will check if a pick-file (see USING 
          PICKLISTS AND PICKFILES below) exists in the current directory. If 
          there is one, the first file in this list is read in. If no 
          pick-file exists, you are prompted for a filename.

          Filenames can be names of existing files, names of non-existing 
          files, or filespecs containing wildcards (eg. *.ASM).

          If an existing file is specified, it's read into the editor. If the 
          file does not exist, the editor is emptied, and the current name is 
          set to the one given. A filespec with wildcards will bring up a 
          window with a list of matching files. Use the cursor keys to 
          choose.


          To abort an operation, it is in most cases possible to press Esc to 
          get back to the text.





                                       EXITING ED
                                       ==========



          When finished editing, exit the program using Alt-X (specified at 
          the bottom of the screen).

          If the current file is not saved, you are asked if you want to save 
          it before the program returns to DOS.

                               DEFAULT FILENAME EXTENSIONS
                               ===========================



          When programming, many files have the same extensions. ED tries to 
          save some work by remembering the extension of the last file read 
          in.

          When a filename is later to be given, there's no need to include 
          the extension if it matches that of the current file.

          To edit a file with no extension at all, give the filename followed 
          by a dot (.). Then ED won't add no extension.





                              USING PICKLISTS AND PICKFILES
                              =============================



          When new files are read into the editor, previous filenames are 
          stored in a so called `pick-list'. In addition to the filenames, 
          this list contains information on where the cursor was in the text, 
          where the block was, and the locations of any position markers.

          To get back to one of the previous files, press F4. This opens a 
          window containing a list of up to the 13 most recent filenames. 
          Position the cursor on the file you want and press return. This 
          brings back the old file, with the cursor on the position it was 
          when this file was left.

          This list might be saved in a pick-file by pressing Alt-F4. This 
          should only be done once, since ED will automatically update this 
          file when one first exists.

          The pick-file is created in the current directory, and it's name is 
          ED.PCK. This can be removed at any time. (Note: The pick-file 
          should be deleted if the files mentioned in it are moved to another 
          directory).

          When ED is started, it will check if there is a pick-file in the 
          current directory. If there is, it is opened, and if no filename is 
          given on the command line, the most recently edited file is read 
          in.

                                     THE STATUS LINE
                                     ===============



          The uppermost line on the screen contains info on how ED is working 
          at the moment.

             Current line and column.

             Whether Insert, AutoIndent and Parenthesis Pairing are on or 
             off.

             If the file is changed since it was last saved. This is marked 
             by an asterisk (*) to the left of the filename.

             The current filename. This is a short form, containing disk and 
             name only. Any directories are not displayed.

          The bottom line lists the most important keys. All other keys are 
          listed in the help-screens.





                                      USING A MOUSE
                                      =============



          A Microsoft-compatible mouse can be used to move the cursor. Just 
          point at the new location, and press the left button. It is not 
          possible to move beyond the last line of text.

          The mouse can be used for fast scrolling too. Put the mouse cursor 
          at the upper or lower status lines, and press the left button to 
          scroll up (closer to the start of the text), or the right button to 
          scroll down.

          Note: The mouse might not work correctly in non-standard screen 
          modes (other that 80 columns).

          (See CONFIGURING ED USING EDSETUP.COM if the mouse doesn't work 
          correctly.)

                                      PECULIARITIES
                                      =============



          ED'S TREATMENT OF TAB

          To ED, the Tab ASCII-code is just another character. All tabs in a 
          file are displayed as small circles, since this is what ASCII 9 
          looks like in the IBM character set.

          Pressing Tab when editing, causes ED to indent the current line, 
          that is: the cursor is moved to the first column where there is a 
          non-blank character in the preceeding line.





                                      ED IN NUMBERS
                                      =============



          Max linelength:                255 
          Max number of lines:         10000 
          Max length of search string:    32 
          Max length of filenames:        80 

          The maximum filesize is given by the amount of free conventional 
          memory. The entire file is always kept in RAM.

                          EXPLANATIONS TO SOME OF THE COMMANDS
                          ====================================



          INSERT AND DELETE

          "Delete Word Right" first removes non-delimiters, then any 
          space-characters up to end of line or a non-space. The following 
          are delimiters: space < > , ; . : ( ) [ ] { } ^ ' = * + - / \ $ #


          BLOCK COMMANDS

          "Copy Block" / "Move Block" will copy/move the highlighted block to 
          the current cursor location. Note that a block can not be copied 
          into itself. The cursor must be _outside_ the block.

          "Indent Block" will add a space character to the start of all lines 
          in the block, thus moving it one column to the right.

          "Unindent Block" possibly removes a space character from the start 
          of all lines in the block, thus moving it one column to the left.


          MISCELLANEOUS

          "Parenthesis Pairing Off/On" is a bit special. ED will 
          automatically enter the right version of the parenthesis you enter, 
          and locate the cursor in between. This might be confusing at first, 
          but it's quite addictive! The following are considered parenthesis: 
          (), [], {} and "". Pairmaking only works when Insert is On.

          "Control Character Prefix" makes it possible to enter characters 
          with ASCII-code less than 32. To enter an ASCII 12 printer eject 
          code, press Ctrl-P followed by L, the 12th letter in the alphabet.

          Options to "Search" or "Search and Replace" can be zero or more of 
          the following:

             G Search Globally, that is: from the start of the document until

                            CONFIGURING ED USING EDSETUP.COM
                            ================================



          It's possible to make permanent changes to ED's setup by using the 
          program EDSETUP.COM. This is useful if you for instance don't like 
          the parenthesis pairing.

          The first choice in EDSETUP is "Reset mouse at start". If the mouse 
          don't work with ED (and you want it to work), try enabling this 
          one. This might increase startup time with a couple of seconds, 
          since some mouse drivers take some time resetting the mouse.

          For EDSETUP to work, ED.COM must be in the current directory, and 
          the file must not be write protected. All changes are written 
          directly into ED.COM, to avoid having to read a configuration file 
          at startup.

                                         =======

                                   FIRST, WHAT'S GOOD.

                    ED is quite small. This results in fast loading.
                                      ED is _free_.



                                    THEN, WHAT'S BAD.

                            There's no _real_ mouse support.
                       And, as mentioned, there's no Tab support.
                     And the options to search/replace are limited.
                                         And ...
