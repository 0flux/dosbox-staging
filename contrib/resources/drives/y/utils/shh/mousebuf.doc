       Resident program (about 3200 bytes) that gives you mouse based copy
       and paste in DOS' textmode.

       If you like the program, please do me a small favour: Send me a note
       (letter or E-mail) and tell me about it. That's worth more than
       a few bucks!



       Usage
       -----

       To be short, hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse to
       mark an area. Release the button to copy the marked area to an
       internal buffer. Press the right mouse button to insert the contents
       of the internal buffer into the keyboard buffer, thus pasting it
       into the current application at the cursor position.

       To avoid conflicts with other programs, you must (unfortunately ?)
       hold down the `hotkey' combination Ctrl and Left Shift while copying
       and pasting. This is not required when at the normal DOS command
       line, or in any other environment that use INT 21h, function 0Ah
       to read a line from the keyboard.



       Starting MOUSEBUF
       -----------------

       The general syntax for starting MOUSEBUF, is as follows:

           MOUSEBUF [options]

       Options can be zero or more of the following:

           -?     Display short help. Any following arguments are ignored.

           -b     Set buffer size to the following number of bytes. The
                  default is -b 1000. Note that it's not possible to change
                  the size once the program is resident.

           -k     Hotkey always needed, that is: Require Ctrl and
                  Left Shift also on DOS' command line. Can later be turned
                  off using -k-.

           -off   Temporarily disable the program. Can be used for instance
                  if uninstall is impossible.

           -on    Reenable program after -off is used.

           -q     Quiet mode, suppress status messages.

           -u     Uninstall program if possible. Any resident program
                  installed after MOUSEBUF must adhere to the AMIS-
                  standard.



       Attention
       ---------

       Be aware of the following:

           * A Microsoft compatible mouse driver is required.

           * If you hear a beep when you release the left button to end
             marking a copy region, it means that too many characters are
             marked (the buffer size is exceeded). MOUSEBUF will store as
             many characters as will fit.

             Other beeps indicate that the mouse driver for some reason
             suddenly needs more bytes to save the mouse state than it
             did when MOUSEBUF was started.

           * If MOUSEBUF can't recognize the current screen mode as text
             mode, it won't let you do any copying or pasting.

           * Trailing whitespace characters are stripped from all fully
             marked lines.



       Finally
       -------

       If you decide to use this program, thanks! I would be happy hearing
       from you if you find any bugs, have any suggestions, or just to know
       that one more person uses my program.
