         2. Let your friends have a copy! (with all files intact, please..)



       Usage
       -----

       XD accepts several options, and several filespecs. Options start
       with a '-' or a '/', and they are all case sensitive. The command
       line syntax is:

           XD [options] [filespec ...]

       If no filespec is given, *.* is assumed.

       Options can be zero or more of the following:

           -?  Display short help.

           -c  Use colors according to the filename extensions. Extensions
               define the following groups: Executables (BAT, COM, EXE),
               text (DOC, ME, TXT), compressed files (ARC, ARJ, HA, LZH,
               PAK, SQZ, ZIP, ZOO), drivers++ (DLL, DRV, SYS), images (BMP,
               GIF, IMG, JPG, PBM, PCX, PIC, SCR, TGA, XBM), garbage ($$$,
               BAK, OLD, TMP) and other files.

               Coloring is on by default. Give -c- to turn it off. Note
               that coloring is always disabled when the output is redir-
               ected from the console.

           -d  Include subdirectory names among the files. This option is
               on by default. Give -d- to turn it off.

           -f  Display free diskspace on the drive(s) from which files are
               listed. This is off by default.

           -h  Include files with hidden/system attributes. This is off
               by default.

           -l  Display filenames using lowercase letters. This is off by
               default.

           -o  Sort the files in the order specified. This option should be
               followed by a sequence of one or more of the following
               letters: nesdt, representing name, extension, size, date and
               time. For example: Entering -oen will group all files by
               extension, and sort on names within the groups.

               By default, no sorting is done. Any sort order specified in
               the environment variable XDCMD (see below) might be turned
               off by entering -o-.

           -p  Pause for each screenful displayed. This also enables
               pausing by pressing the space key. When pausing, Press Esc,
               Q or Ctrl-C to abort, or any other key to continue listing.

               This option is on by default. Give -p- to turn if off.
               Like coloring, pausing is always disabled when the program
               output is redirected.

           -s  Use a `bar' to separate columns in the output. This is on
               by default, and may be disabled using -s-.

           -t  Display total number of bytes used by all files listed. This
               is on by default, use -t- to turn it off.

           -u  Don't include the . and .. directoryfiles, unless hidden
               files should be included. This makes the program a bit more
               (Unix) ls-like.

           -w  What to display. Follow this option by a combination of one
               or more of the letters fFnesdDtTa, representing full name
               (name.ext), full name with Unix' ls-like filetype character,
               name, extension, size, short date (no separator), date,
               short time (no separator), time, and attributes. Attributs
               are: Archive-bit, Read-only, Hidden and System. The default
               What-combination is nesDT, giving a listing equal to the
               `normal' DIR-command (but in two columns).

       The output is arranged in columns. The number of columns is given by
       the width of the output for each file, according to the -w option.

       If XD finds that standard input is redirected, it will read file-
       specs from it.



       The environment variable XDCMD
       ------------------------------

       Before the command line options are interpreted, XD looks for an
       environment variable named XDCMD. This might contain frequently used
       options. If you for instance don't like the coloring, and would like
       to know the free space on the disk, enter the following line in your
       AUTOEXEC.BAT:

           SET XDCMD=-c- -f

       Any sequence of legal options may be given, and they can all be
       overridden on the command line.



       Finally
       -------

       If you decide to use this program, thanks! I would be happy hearing
       from you if you find any bugs, have any suggestions, or just to know
       that one more person uses my program.
